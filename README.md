# Welcome Anyone!
This is a repo holding my Perfect video tutorials with its corresponding source code.

I plan on making tutorials on Perfect as I continue to learn the framework so you will learn as I will. Unless of course you
learn Perfect at a faster pace than I upload tutorials... This is highly recommended.

A list of other Perfect Tutorials can be found at [perfect.org/tutorials](http://perfect.org/tutorials.html). 

Also, my favourite Perfect video tutorials series that I've found so far [Ryan Collins - Perfect Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE2M81Pddau3LrJRGPbc6UXMy3VQuA2lL). There he covers similar topics that I did plus more and in much greater detail.
